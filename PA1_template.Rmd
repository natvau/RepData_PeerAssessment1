## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
````

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
split <- split(data, data$date)
total_steps <- sapply(X=split, FUN=function(x) sum(na.omit(x$steps)))
library(lattice)
histogram(total_steps)
mean <- lapply(X=split, FUN=function(x) mean(na.omit(x$steps)))
mean
median <- lapply(X=split, FUN=function(x) median(na.omit(x$steps)))
median
````

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Sorry I couldn't finished on time
```{r}
data2 <- data[data$interval==5,]

max_num_steps <- which(data2 == max(na.omit(data2$steps)))
max_num_steps
data2[max_num_steps,]
````
## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
